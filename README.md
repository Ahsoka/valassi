# Valassi

Repo for automating tasks in The Division.  Named after host of "Wouldn't You Know It", Rick Valassi.

Some of the stuff this repo will eventually allow is:
* [ ] Mass buying and destructing items for crafting materials.
* [ ] Automatically opening sealed caches.
* [ ] Mass crafting items until the desired talents are obtained.

Will add more ideas as well.
