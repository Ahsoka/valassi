# Valassi

Repo for automating tasks in The Division.  Named after host of "Wouldn't You Know It", Rick Valassi.

Some of the stuff this repo will eventually allow is:
* [X] Mass buying and destructing items for crafting materials (partially implemented, not thoroughly tested, for optimal results use the technique in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOkem-FFdf8&t=298s)).
* [X] Automatically opening sealed caches (partially implemented, not thoroughly tested).
* [ ] Mass crafting items until the desired talents are obtained.

Will add more ideas as well.
